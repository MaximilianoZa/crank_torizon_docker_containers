# Crank Software Torizon Docker Containers Demos Repository

## Overview
This repository contains projects showcasing how to create Docker containers that package Storyboard applications to run in Torizon. It uses Weston as the Wayland compositor to manage the graphical stack and leverage GPU acceleration.
**Please note that the runtime engine code is not included in these demos but can be found in the Storyboard installation path.**

## Getting Started

Each demo project requires  different instructions on how to set up and run the demo. Please refer to the general *README* file with the step-by-step guides.
